<!-- Forums & Categories -->
<p><span class="medium">Forums &amp; Categories</span><br>
    <br>
    <a name="forums_add"><b>Create a Forum</b></a><br>
  Creating a forum is crucial if you want to allow users to post topics in specific areas. <b>However</b>,
  you
  need to create a category first in which you place the forums under. To do this you have to create a
  forum with the top drop down menu saying 'Create a category'. After you have created a category you
  can then add forums under the categories by selecting it in the drop down menu when creating a new
  forum. If you want to go one step further you can create sub-forums by selecting the forum in the drop
  down box. MercuryBoard is built so you can have as many categories, forums, sub-forums as you like 
  and can even continue adding forum under sub-forums until you are happy!<br>
  <br>
  At the bottom of the page there is another drop down menu called quick permissions. This enables you
  to select another forum already built and use the permission that you might of set for groups on that
  forum for this one.
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>note</em>:When creating a category, the description will not be shown so it is unnecessary for you to add one!<br>
  <br/>
  <a name="forums_edit"><b>Edit a Forum</b></a><br/>
  After selecting which forum or cato gory you wish to edit by simply clicking on the hyperlink you to can change the: Parent Category, Forum Name and Forum Description.
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name="forums_delete"><b>Delete a Forum</b></a><br>
  Deletes
  any forum or category you choose by clicking on the correct hyperlink. <strong>This action cannot be reversed.</strong>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name="forums_order"><b>Change the forum ordering</b></a><br>
  The important fact to remember when using this feature is that all numbering should start at 0. The ordering of the categories is separate from the order of the forums under the categories, this means that under each category the numbering should start at zero every time.
  <br> 
  <br>
  <a name="forums_count"><b>Recount topics &amp; replies</b></a><br>
  When topics and posts have been deleted sometimes the board statistics are wrong, this can be fixed by running this feature.
  <hr>
  <!-- Emoticons -->
  <br>
  <span class="medium">Emoticons</span><br>
    <br>
	<a name='emot_control_import'><b>Install Emoticons</b></a><br>
  If you have a skin other than Candy Corn installed you may wish to install the emoticons that come with the skin. This features allows you to install them without the hassle of setting up their unique names etc. it will take the names that the skinner already has preset.
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='emot_control_add'><b>Add Emoticons</b></a><br>
  This tool allows you to manually add emoticons to the set you already have installed. There are three attributes that you need to add: Text - this is the description of the emoticon you are adding, Image - select the image file that you have inserted into the emoticons directory under skins, and finally Clickable - if you check this box then if will be added to the clickable smilies box when you post.
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='emot_control_edit'><b>Edit or Delete Emoticons</b></a><br>
  This feature will show you a list of the current emoticons installed and what attributes they have. You can go on to edit or delete them deciding on what hyperlink you click.  
  <hr>
  <!-- Groups -->
  <br>
  <span class="medium">Groups</span><br>
    <br> 
   <a name='groups_add'><b>Create a group</b></a><br>
   Groups are very powerful when it comes to managing a big community. They are allow you to place all the members which should have the same permissions under one group permissions rather than having to change member permission for each one them. When creating a group you will be faced with two boxes, one will say 'new user groups name' and the other say 'based on'. In the first box you simply place the name you wish your group to be called. In the second you will have a drop down list of current groups, use this to copy the groups basic permissions to your new group - so select the group which is closes to the group permissions you wish to create.
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='groups_edit'><b>Edit a group's name</b></a><br>
  You may wish to edit a group you have created or one of the default groups. First, just select the group you wish to edit and press submit. Now you should be able to change the group type, name and display formatting. The first, group type, you will find that you cannot edit this because it is the name of the board constants used in the PHP code. You can edit the group name and how it is formatted, so if it is bold, italic, blue, orange, etc.
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='groups_perms'><b>Edit a group's permissions</b></a><br>
  This feature allows you to set group permission which is the fundamental reason for using groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='groups_delete'><b>Delete a group</b></a><br>
  Just select a group to delete and then press confirm to delete. Be careful when deleting groups especially the default groups. 
   <hr>
  <!-- Members -->
  <br>
  <span class="medium">Members</span><br>
    <br> 
  <a name='members_profile'><b>Edit a member</b></a><br>
  You can edit a members profile through this feature.
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='members_delete'><b>Delete a member</b></a><br>
  Deleting a member will remove them from being able to use the board with the username and password, you could just change the group to banned. If you still wish to delete the member then it is a good idea to use the 'Fix the member statistics' feature.<br>
  <br>
  <a name='members_perms'><b>Edit a member's permission</b></a><br>
  Group permissions are usual good enough to handle your every day needs but if you wish to set permissions just for a specific user then this feature allows you to do this. <strong>Remember:</strong> You need to untick the top box with the red dashed border saying 'use only group permissions' otherwise your changes will have no effect. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='titles_add'><b>Add automatic member titles</b></a><br>
  The default titles are: Newbie,  Member, MercuryBoarder, Full Member, Mercury Guru and these all work off how many posts you have made. Adding titles is very easy when using this feature because all you have to submit is the title name, image and minimum post count. The default images are the five dots seen underneath the members avatar else under their member title. <em>If you wish to edit the existing member titles please use the feature described below. </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='titles_edit'><b>Edit or delete automatic member titles</b></a><br>
  This feature is very powerful but can be very damaging if not used correctly. The key rule here is <strong>it is better to edit the existing titles than <em>deleting</em> them.</strong> Here is where you can edit the names of the titles and change there image and minimum posts. Also remember that the board uses the titles so <strong>you must not delete all of <br>
  them.</strong>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='ban_ip'><b>Ban IP addresses</b></a><br>
  Some members or guests might wish to spam your board or make a nuisance of themselves so banning their IP might be the only answer. Their IP is shown at the bottom of all posts they make, if you notice there is always one digit which changes then you can use a * as a wildcard. If you find it is a member that is causing you problems then you can change their group to banned but <strong>do not place the Guest account into the banned group. </strong> 
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='mass_mail'><b>Send an email to your members</b></a><br>
  This is a mass email system that will send email to members which are in selected groups, you choose the groups you wish to send the email to on the send form under 'Recipient Groups'. Members often find this feature useful if they do not visit the board on a day to day basis so an email from the admin about recent announcements can be helpful. <strong>However,</strong> over use of this feature can upset some members who do not wish<br>
  to keep receiving emails, so use this feature sparingly.
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='membercount'><b>Fix the member statistics</b></a><br>
  After deleting members the board might not update the member statistics so running this feature will keep them up to date.
   <hr>
  <!-- Database -->
  <br>
  <span class="medium">Database</span><br>
  <br> 
  <a name='backup_create'><b>Backup the database</b></a><br>
  Backing up the database creates a file, 'mb-<em>date</em>.mbb', which can be used to restore your database settings when you last backed up. This allows you to keep a backup of your board safe just incase your server crashes and looses all your MySQL data, which can happen from time to time. It is usually recommended to backup your database before upgrading and then straight after upgrading. <strong>If you upgrade and the a table structure changes then your old backups will not work without editing them, so backup straight after an upgrade. </strong>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='backup_restore'><b>Restore a backup</b></a><br>
  If you have backed up your board and have a MercuryBoard Backup file (.mbb) then you can use this feature to restore all database settings to those when you backed up.
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='settings_db'><b>Edit connection settings</b></a><br>
  When you first installed MercuryBoard you had to submit your database connection settings, this is where you can edit those you settings if they change.
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='optimize'><b>Optimize the database</b></a><br>
  <em>OPTIMIZE TABLE should be used if you have deleted a large part of a table or if you have made many changes to a table with variable-length rows (tables that have VARCHAR, BLOB, or TEXT columns). Deleted records are maintained in a linked list and subsequent INSERT operations reuse old record positions. You can use OPTIMIZE TABLE to reclaim the unused space and to defragment the data file. - from MySQL Reference Manual<br>
  <br>
  </em>MercuryBoard very rarely performs big changes to tables structures and data structures so this feature does not generally need to be used, as recommended:<br>
  <br>
  <em>Even if you do a lot of updates to variable-length rows, it's not likely that you need to do this more than once a week or month and only on certain tables. - from MySQL Reference Manual</em>   <br>
  <br>
  This means that you do not need to much notice about this feature unless you are MODing the board or have a seriously big forum!
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='query'><b>Execute an SQL query</b></a><br>
  Allows you to perform queries on the MySQL database without needing a MySQL command line or web tool. 
   <hr>
  <!-- Skins -->
  <br>
  <span class="medium">Skins</span><br>
  <br> 
  <a name='templates_html'><b>Edit HTML templates</b></a><br>
  All the HTML for the board is kept in what is known as the HTML templates. These are rows in the MySQL database which are called when needed. You can edit the templates through this feature and they are sorted out into categories. If you also know PHP you can add if conditionals and variables into the templates to help you make a new skin or add features. Before editing the templates it is a good idea to create a new<br>
  skin. <em>- see below</em>  <br>
  <br> 
  <a name='templates_skin'><b>Create a skin</b></a><br>
  Before editing any HTML templates it is always a good idea to create a new skin, then you have the choice between the default skin (candy corn) or the new one you created. A skin is just the collection of templates.
  <br>
  <br> 
  <a name='templates_editskin'><b>Edit or delete a skin</b></a><br>
  If you wish to change the name of a skin you have created or change the directory name where it is kept then this will help. You can edit the name of the skin, the directory of where the skin is kept and at the bottom there is a tick box if you wish to delete the selected skin. 
  <br>
  <br> 
  <a name='templates_load'><b>Install a skin</b></a><br>
  MercuryBoard has a powerful skinning system which allows you to install skins that other people have created. To do this all you have to have is the MercuryBoard skin file (.mbs) and just let it do the rest! This means you can install pre-made skins and even share your skin with everyone else, <em>to do this see export skins below.</em>
  <br>
  <br> 
  <a name='templates_export'><b>Export a skin</b></a><br>
  This is the feature that will allow you to show your skin off to others, just click on this link and then select the skin you want to export. Then just show off using the .mbs file. 
   <hr>
  <!-- Help -->
  <br>
  <span class="medium">Help Articles</span><br>
  <br> 
  <a name='help_new'><b>Create a help article</b></a><br>
  Help articles are displayed in the help section on the board, along side the search feature. You can create a help article for your board by using this feature. First you need to create a title, this will also become a link at the top of the help page for uses to jump down to get to your article. After that you just need to type your article up, <strong>remember that HTML is needed</strong> to format your article for example, a line break needs the HTML tag '&lt;br /&gt;'.
  <br>
  <br> 
  <a name='help_edit'><b>Edit a help article</b></a><br>
  You may wish to edit an already existing help article, all you have to do is to select the title of the article you wish to edit. Looking at the default articles might help you understand how the help system works. 
  <br>
  <br> 
  <a name='help_delete'><b>Delete a help article</b></a><br>
  This allows you to delete existing help articles that you might not want to be displayed anymore.
   <hr>
  <!-- Settings -->
  <br>
  <span class="medium">Settings</span><br>
  <br>
  <a name='settings_basic'><b>Edit board settings</b></a><br>
  This is the control center of your board and what settings it has, even if you have no desire to change your settings it is always worth having a look at this feature. Within the feature you can: open or close the board, make a closed notice, change its name, attachments, attachment file extensions, topics per page, posts per page, email validation and a whole lot more!! 
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='censoring'><b>Censor Words</b></a><br>
  Censoring words can be an important feature if you wish to keep the language on the board clean but want members to say what they want. A wildcard can also be used in this feature but be careful that you don't censor every word! 
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='php_info'><b>View PHP information</b></a><br>
  This page will show you all the information about the PHP installation built on your server. It uses the basic phpinfo() function to show you all the statistics about the zend engine and should show you how MySQL has been configured to work with PHP. Some hosts may have disabled this so you might just get an error message telling you this.
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='logs'><b>View moderator actions</b></a><br>
  All moderator actions performed on the board is recorded and logged in this log. It will show when the action was performed, whish user performed it, the action performed and what topic it has been performed on. This is a good way of looking after what your moderator team is doing. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name='stats'><b>Statistics center</b></a><br>
  The center will show you two graphs, one showing posts by month and the other showing registrations by month. However, you need to have the correct GD libraries installed to view this page. </div>
