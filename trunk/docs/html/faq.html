<span class='large'>Frequently Asked Questions</span><br />
<br />
Here is a compiled list of question frequently asked in the support forum, these questions vary from help with installation
to how to create a new skin. <br/><br/>
<hr /><br />

<span class='medium'>Most common questions</span><br /><br />

<b>I can't post on the board I just created</b><br />
You need to create a category AND a forum to be able to post. 
You can do this through <i>Admin CP -> Create a Forum</i>.  Be sure to use default, full or 
permissions from a group or forum already created. Otherwise you've created a forum fully locked down so even administrators cannot access it! <br/>
<br/>

<b>The board is blank or garbled</b><br />
This could be because your server does not support GZip compression. You can turn
this feature off by going into <i>Admin CP -> Edit Board Settings</i> and disable GZIP, you board
should work as normal after this. <br /><br />

<b>When people try and register they get a JpGraph error</b><br />
This is because your web server does not have the required software to run anti-robot registration. Disable
it through <i>Admin CP -> Edit Board Settings</i>, it is disabled by default.<br/><br/>

<b>How do I set the board to email registration validation?</b><br/>
Mercuryboard does not email newly registered users by default. You can turn it on in <i>Admin CP -> 
Edit Board Settings -> Require users be validated by email</i>. This will send an email to newly registered 
users with a link they must click before they become "active" members. Make sure your board email settings 
are correct! <br/><br/>

<b>The link it's emailing people is wrong. There's no domain name in it.</b><br/>
You need to enter the site address in <i>Admin CP -> Edit Board Settings -> Location of Board</i>. This must be set
 to the root of your domain address with no trailing slash. <i>http://mysite.com</i> is good. 
 <i>http://mysite.com/~geoff/forum</i> is bad. <br/><br/>

<b>I can't login to my forum anymore!</b><br/>
Don't ban guests! It requires some very complicated SQL or editing PHP files to get back into your site! 
All groups except "Banned" should have "Use MercuryBoard" ticked or else you are banning that group from 
even login and logout!<br/><br/>

<b>How do I use the Admin CP?</b><br/>
MercuryBoard now has documentation on how to use the Admin CP, you can access this document by either
going into the Admin CP and clicking on the help link at the top of the page, or <a href="admin_help.html">click here</a>.<br/>

<br /><hr /><br />

<span class='medium'>Advanced questions</span><br /><br />

<b>Can I put PHP code inside a HTML template?</b><br/>
You can get creative using the following syntax:<i>(but without the spaces after '<')</i><br/>
< IF (php condition)>(html output)< /IF> <br/><br/>

<b>How do I disable the subscribe option?</b><br/>
You will need to edit the templates to remove the subscribe button. This isn't the best solution as 
someone who knows the url to type in could still subscribe. But it is the easiest.<br/><br/>

Go into <i>Admin CP -> Edit HTML Templates</i> and select the skin to edit.
Then go to <i>Topics -> Topic View</i><br/>
Remove the last 3 lines<br/>
Save changes and continue to return to the templates list<br/><br/>

Then go to <i>Forums -> Forum View</i>
Look for<br/><br/>


< p style='text-align:center'>
  < br />< a href='{$this->self}?a=cp&amp;s=addsub&amp;... snipped off rest of line for IE users
< /p><br/><br/>

and remove that chunk. Save and you're done! This will not remove existing subscriptions. You'll need some database knowledge for that.<br/><br/>

<b>I installed a new skin but now can't edit/delete the images for it. Why can't I edit files I created?</b><br/>
It's all about permissions and ownership.<br/><br/>

When you connect to the webserver through FTP you connect as a specific user (let's say halfling) and can create 
files that belong to halfling. You have permission, through FTP to change permissions, rename, delete, replace, etc.<br/><br/>

Now when the web server creates a file (such as installing a skin from an mbs) it creates them as belonging to the user 
running webserver (nobody or a specific user like apache). That user can change permissions, rename, delete, replace, etc.
(note: Yes there is a user called nobody)<br/><br/>

The problem comes when these two don't overlap. Nobody creates a file that halfling can't delete. Or halfling creates a directory 
that nobody can't write to. Why we change permissions of other files and directories (typically to 777 or 775) is so nobody has 
access to write that file. Unfortunately the skin creation process doesn't (as yet) make the files so you can always FTP in to edit or delete them.<br/><br/>

Solution? You can delete the skin through admincp. You can ask your web host administrator to change the ownership of the files. 
You can create a script to change the owner/permissions of the files. Or you can download the files, create a script to delete them, 
and then upload them as new.<br/><br/>

Best and easiest is to talk to your hosting provider. They may fix things so it wont happen in the future.<br/><br/>

<b>I want to change how the board looks. Where do I do this?</b><br/>
Mercuryboard uses a skinning system that consists of templates, css and some graphics. You can find the css and graphics under the skins 
directory. The html templates can be edited through the admin cp. You should not need to edit PHP files to change the boards appearance. Also there 
are a lot of tricks you can do just in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_reference.asp" target="_blank">CSS</a>. <br/>

<span class='medium'>Project questions</span><br /><br />

<b>How can I join the Mercury Team?</b><br/>
The team itself is not currently looking for any new members, however, the project runs on what other
people apart from the team contribute, so if you have a good feature then it might get added to a release.<br/><br/>

<b>Can I edit the source code?</b><br/>
Yes, 'Modding' the board is encouraged by the Mercury team so others can realize the power behind the 
project as well as post 'Mods' in the showcase forum of the main site. This allows others to use your
Mods if you wish and is also a catalogue of what others have done, so take a look! Please take a look at 
<a href="coding_standards.htm">MercuryBoard's coding standards</a> and the <a href="license.htm">GNU GPL License</a>.<br/>
<br/>

<b>What is the difference between MercuryBoard and QuickSilver Forums?</b><br/>
QuickSilver Forums was built off MercuryBoard and is now a separate project, so MercuryBoard is like the father really!
